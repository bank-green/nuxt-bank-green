# CMS with Prismic

Read the [Prismic & Nuxt docs](https://prismic.io/docs/nuxt) to understand how to use Prismic with Nuxt.

# Known issues

- We're using the Vue Composition API in all components, but only some of them use [SFCs (single-file components)](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/sfc.html) (i.e. `<script setup>`. Nuxt is fairly opinionated about this with its magic and we should be using SFCs everywhere, so I migrate them whenever I see them.)
