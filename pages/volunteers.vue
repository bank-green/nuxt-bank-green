            <p>
              Although we are beginning to fundraise, we are still currently led by volunteers!
              If you would like to extend your climate impact beyond talking to your bank or
              switching to a greener alternative, we would love for you to join our team!
            </p>
            <p>
              Please do reach out to volunteers@bank.green, attaching a copy of your C.V. and
              letting us know about your availability! We are still a small team and receive a lot of enquiries,
              but we will do our best to get back to you, even if we feel it may not be the best fit.
